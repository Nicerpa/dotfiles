# Xmonad

I'm currently using Ubuntu so the installation and the packages are for Debian
based Linux distros

First install xmonad

```
sudo apt install xmonad libghc-xmonad-contrib-dev
```

and some usefull programns

```
sudo apt install xterm dmenu
```
the reason for install `xterm` is that this is the Xmonad default terminal, so
if you don't have you won't be able to spawn terminal

you may need to install this

```
sudo apt install menu
```
